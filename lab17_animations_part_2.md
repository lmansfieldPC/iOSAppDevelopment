# Lab 17 - Animations #2

Check out the [Class Notes 11](https://github.com/lmansfieldPC/iOSAppDevelopment/blob/main/Class_Notes_11_Animations.md), especially Parts 5 and 6.

In this lab, you will be given no starter code. You will be shown a working app in class, that involves animating three different shapes. You must try to recreate the app based on what you observe in class. 

The app you will see has a purple circle that grows and shrinks automatically. It has a blue rectangle that rotates 90 degrees when tapped. And it has a yellow star that, when the users taps it bounces up and down and swithces back and forth between red and yellow. 

Finally, the app has a linear gradident that gradually switches from red to white then white to red infinitely.

None of the shapes overlap when animating or when still.

**Extra Challenge** (Optional):
1. Add a third shape. It can be any shape you'd like but `arrow.left.and.right.square` might be appropriate. Initially, the shape should be on the left side of the screen. When the user taps the button, it moves to right side. If the user taps the button again, it moves back to the left side. It may be helpful to use a Boolean variable as a `toggle` to get this to work. You can use any animation effect you'd like, but `.bouncy` will look nice.

1. Also have the arrow change color when the user taps it.

1. Also have the arrow flip using a 3D-rotation effect so that it is flipped (like a pancake) when the user taps it.
