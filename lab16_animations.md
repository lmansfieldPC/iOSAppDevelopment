# Lab 17 - Animations

In this lab, you will be given no starter code. You must create a project acheives the following benchmarks below. 

Check out the [Class Notes 11](https://github.com/lmansfieldPC/iOSAppDevelopment/blob/main/Class_Notes_11_Animations.md)

## Problem 1
Make a button that is the shape of a Rounded Rectangle with a background color that get's increasingly blurry when the user taps the button.


## Problem 2
Draw a Rectangle() object with a foreground color and frame that automatically changes between two colors when the application loads. Use a `.spring` animation type with a duration of 2 seconds. 


## Problem 3 
Draw a Circle() that automatically moves diagonally across the screen, back and forth. Also, have the Circle change between two colors as it animates back and forth.

## Problem 4
Draw an Ellipse that automatically gets bigger until it fill the entire background of the screen. The other elements in your app should appear above the ellipse so they are still visible.
