# Lab 18 - Animations #3

Check out the [Class Notes 12](https://github.com/lmansfieldPC/iOSAppDevelopment/blob/main/Class_Notes12_Animation_Dispatch_and_Timer.md).

In this lab, you will be given no starter code. You will be shown a working app in class and you must try to recreate the app based on what you observe in class. 

The app includes a cloud that rotates around an invisible point. It includes a rectangle that rotates about its center. Both the cloud and rectangle change color when tapped. Finally, There is another circle that rotates in the opposite direction about the rectangle. This circle returns to its start point when tapped.
